# energyRt 0.50.9-dev

**New features & critical changes in the model code:**

-   Weighting of time-slices in a subset has been revised and rewritten.
    Since this version, all variables with 'slice' dimension are not
    weighed for consistency of slice-level operation across sampled and
    non-sampled model runs.

-   Slice-weights can vary across model years.

-   All variables with 'year' dimension are not weighted to the interval
    lengths. \
    Exception:

    -   cumulative variables (`vSupReserveCum`, etc.) which have to
        account the interval length for every milestone year. 

    -   capacity variables (`vTechCap`, etc.) represent the state of the
        variable by the end of the period, including any accumulation or
        retirement of capacity over the interval of the milestone year.

-   New capacity variables (`vTechNewCap`, etc.) are given for a year.
    Period length (`pPeriodLen`) must be applied to the annual capacity
    additions (such as `vTechNewCap`) to get total new capacity of a
    process by the end of each period.

-   System costs have been regrouped by type (capital, fixed O&M,
    variable O&M, supply, taxes, subsidies) and by process type
    (technology, trade, storage, etc.) to facilitate the analysis of the
    cost structure. Total Costs equation has been rewritten to reflect
    the new cost structure.\
    \
    **Bug fixes**

-   Early retirement option (`optimizeRetirment = TRUE`) is corrected to
    exclude retirement of "new" technologies at the same time as their
    installation.

-   `draw()` method for 'trade' is fixed to exclude repeated arrows in
    the plot.

-   `newCosts()` is debugged, an example is added to the Utopia
    tutorial.

-   `tsl2hour()` fixed to be able identify n-digits hours (previously
    worked for 2 only).\
    \
    **Miscellaneous**

-   A new version (3) of the logo design idea (by DALL-E).

-   The code clean-up, testing, and documentation are in progress to
    comply with CRAN requirements.

-   Functions/method in progress: `levcost()` and `report()`,

-   `add_weights` and `add_intervals` arguments will be added to
    `getData()` function to add time-slice weights and interval lengths
    to the requested data if applicable.

# energyRt 0.50.7-dev

-   Fixed a few stability issues in the `draw()` method.
-   Added "Hello World" example to the tutorial.
-   A new version of the logo design idea (by DALL-E).
-   The code clean-up and documentation are in progress to comply with
    CRAN requirements.
-   The very first draft of the package CRAN-like
    [manual](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/blob/master/man/figures/energyRt-manual.pdf)
    is added.
-   The version might be unstable due to ongoing changes.

# energyRt 0.50.6-dev

-   draw() is drafted for all processes: 'technology', 'export',
    'import', 'supply', 'demand', 'trade', 'storage
-   docs completed for main classes with examples.
-   code clean-up and documentation in progress.

# energyRt 0.50.5-dev

-   draw() is rewritten based on 'grid' package, and is now a generic
    method.
-   added draw() methods for 'technology', 'export', and 'import'
    classes.
-   fixed several interface-level bugs introduced in 0.50.4-dev during
    clean-up and documentation.

# energyRt 0.50.4-dev

-   Documentation of classes is in progress (\~70% docs completed).
-   Logo-search has started! "logo" page added.
-   Website is reshaped, added new, not populated yet "articles".
-   !!! Not Tested!!! Due to the ongoing changes in both documentation
    and functions/methods clean-up, the version may have "surprises" -
    tests are in progress.

# energyRt 0.50.3-dev

-   Development version in the preparation for CRAN submission.
-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   Added functions to document classes from yaml file 'classes.yaml'.
-   `technology-class` and `newTechnology` function documented.
