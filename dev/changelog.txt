energyRt 0.11.18-23 @dev (Mar 3 2024)
BREAKING CHANGES:
* `constraint-class` got `@interpolation` slot to override default interpolation of `rhs` parameter (as well as `for.each`). The newConstraint function is updating accordingly.
* changed default interpolation rule for constraints to `inter` (`back.inter.forth` previously).
* changed default value (defVal) - it is recomended to specify default value when it is created. If not specified, Inf or zero is used, based on the equation/inequality type.
* temporary fix: to avoid dropping zeros during current interpolation of constraint@rhs (known issue), zeros are authoreplaced by small numbers (1e-20) - will be resolved in new interpolation routine.

OTHER
* adjusted behaviour of default tmp.dir in `solve` when no path is given.
* UTOPIA example - some updates, dropping 'raster' dependency in favour of 'sf'.

energyRt 0.11.18-22 @dev (Mar 1 2024)

BUG FIXES
* several minor bug fixes and improvements in the `solve` methods
* added missing interpolation of constraints when given years are beyond the model horizon. Still, a temporary patch, the interpolation routine is to be rewritten in the future, with focus on arrow and dplyr packages.
* Utopia updated to the recent version of the package. More changes are comming.

OTHER
* tests using 'testthat' package are initiated and in progress.

energyRt 0.11.17.9000 @dev (Feb 18 2024)

NEW FEATURES
* added options to control the package behavior (in development)
* initiated class `registry` to store information about scenarios, models, and repositories, and call them by name eventually (in development)
* added `newScenario` function to create a new scenario and register it in a `registry` (in development)

OTHER
* changed/improved the behaviour of `solve` and `interpolate` methods to unify their behavior, including `tmp.dir` that is managed by a function.

energyRt 0.11.15.9000 @dev (Feb 11 2024)
BREAKING CHANGES
# RENAMINGs:
* eqSupTotal -> eqSupReserve
* eqExport -> eqExportTot
* eqImport -> eqImportTot
* eqExportRowCumulative -> eqExportRowCum
* eqImportRowCumulative -> eqImportRowCum
* vExportRowAccumulated -> vExportRowCum
* vImportRowAccumulated -> vImportRowCum
* eqAggOut -> eqAggOutTot
* vImportRowAccumulated -> vImportRowCum
* eqImportRowAccumulated -> eqImportRowCum
* mExportRowAccumulatedUp -> mExportRowCumUp
* mExportRowAccumulatedLo -> mExportRowCumLo

BUG FIXES
* added missing (?? - tests in progress) `pTradeIrCost(trade, region, dst, year, slice)` in "Export (IR)" part of 'eqCostIrTrade(region, year)'
* Subsetting of time-slices has been debugged and tested. The subsetting returns the same objective in simple models with no differences in load across subset and full time-slices set. Totals and costs variables are weighted by the sample weights. The rule of thumb in applying the sample weights:
 - all variables without slice dimension are weighted by the sample weights where nessessary (invcost, fixcost, eac are in annual timeframe and don't have to be weighted)
 - all variables with "Tot", "Total", "Accumulated", "Cum" indicate that the weights have been applied
 - all costs aggregates are weighted (== no slice dimension)

ToDo:
 * Check vAggOutTot: add vAggOut?
 * Validate eqStorageClean: validate t or t-1


energyRt 0.11.14.9000 @dev (Feb 09 2024)
BREAKING CHANGES
* @stock slot is depreciated, parameter `stock` moved to @capacity slot
* trade@trade$cost is renamed and moved to trade@varom$varom
* trade@start, @end, @olife changed from numeric to data.frame format for consistency across classes
* early.retirement is renamed to optimizeRetirement

NEW FEATURES
* added new parameters @capacity cap.up, cap.lo, ncap.up, ncap.lo, ret.up, ret.lo constraints on capacity, new capacity, retirement for technology, storage, and trade. (retirement is not implemented yet for storage and trade.)
* added trade@fixom slot and parameter
* added trade@varom slot with varom (renamed `cost`) and markup (from @trade slot) parameters
* added tech@invcost@retcost - costs of early retirement of stock and new installations

STARTED/RESERVED/NOT IMPLEMENTED
* added early (optimized / endogenous) retirement of stock and new installations in storage and trade classes.

energyRt 0.11.13.9000 @dev (Feb 05 2024)
BUG FIXES
* early.retirement interpolation error (dplyr, NULL object) fixed in `technology` class

OTHER CHANGES
* export/import format for "gdx" ignores case.

NEW FEATURES
* added functions to set/get python and julia paths

energyRt 0.11.12.9000 @dev (Feb 05 2024)
NEW FEATURES
* added (reserved, not implemented) `@capacity` slots to `technology`, `storage`, and `trade` classes for futher implementation of additional parameters and constraints, including bounds on total capacity, new capacity, and individual weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each technology, storage, and trade (a column in the @invcost slot). The @stock slot is to be deprecated in the future, moving the `stock` column to the @capacity slots.
* added (reserved, not implemented) `@fixom` and `@varom` slots to trade.
* !!!ToDo: add warnings for deprecated slots and unused yet (reserved) slots.
* added preset `solver_options` for alternative languages, solvers, and methods.

energyRt 0.11.11.9000 @dev (Feb 04 2024)
BUG FIXES
* fixed duplicated columns in getData when arrow used
* error handle in read_results when model is not solved
* custom constraints translation to JuMP, Python, MathProg (still unstable)

NEW FEATURES
* added progress bar tools
