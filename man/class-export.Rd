\title{An S4 class to represent commodity export to the rest of the world.}
\description{
Export object represent commodity export to the Rest of the World (RoW).
}
\details{
\code{export} is a type of process that adds an "external" source to a commodity
to the model. The Rest of the World (RoW) is not modeled explicitly,
\code{export} and \code{import} objects define and control the exchange with the RoW.
The operation of the export object is similar to the \code{demand} objects,
the two different classes are used to distinguish domestic and external
sources of final consumption.
The export is controlled by the \code{exp} data frame, which specifies
bounds and fixed values for the export of the export flow.
The \code{exp.fx} column is used to specify fixed values of the export flow,
making the export flow exogenous. The \code{exp.lo} and \code{exp.up} columns are used
to specify lower and upper bounds of the export flow, making the export flow
endogenous. The \code{price} column is used to specify the exogenous price
for the export commodity.
The \code{reserve} slot is used to set limits on the total export over the
model horizon.
