\usage{
newCommodity(
  name = "",
  desc = "",
  limtype = "LO",
  timeframe = character(),
  unit = character(),
  agg = data.frame(),
  emis = data.frame(),
  misc = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character. Name of the commodity.}

\item{desc}{character. Optional description of the commodity for reference.}

\item{limtype}{factor or character. The limit type of the commodity in balance equation, "LO", "UP", or "FX". "LO" by default, meaning that the level of commodity in the model is restricted with the lower bound, excess is allowed. "UP" means that the level of commodity cannot exceed the upper bound. "FX" means that total commudity supply and demand are equal, no excess or deficit is allowed.}

\item{timeframe}{character. The default time-frame this commodity operates in the model. The lowest timeframe in the model is used by default.}

\item{unit}{character. The main unit of the commodity used in the model.}

\item{agg}{data.frame. Used to define an aggregation of several commodities into the \code{name} commodity.

\describe{
\item{comm}{character. Name of a commodity being aggregated.}
\item{unit}{character. Unit of the commodity being aggregated.}
\item{agg}{numeric. weight of the commodity in the aggregation, must be set for all aggregated commodities.
}
}}

\item{emis}{data.frame. Emissions factors related to the commodity consumption (if "combustion" parameter of a technology which consumes the commodity is > 0).

\describe{
\item{comm}{character. Name of the emitted commodity.}
\item{unit}{character. Unit of the emission factor.}
\item{emis}{numeric. Emission factor, emissions released per unit of the consumed commodity.
}
}}

\item{misc}{list. List of additional parameters that are not used in the model but can be used for reference or user-defined functions. For example, links to the source of the commodity data, or other metadata.}
