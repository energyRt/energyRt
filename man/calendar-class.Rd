\description{
An S4 class to represent sub-annual time resolution structure (time-frames and time-slices).
}
\details{
Sub-annual time resolution is represented by nested, named fractions of a year ("slices").
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{timeframes}}{a named list of nested sub-annual levels with vectors of individual elements.}

\item{\code{timetable}}{data.frame with levels of slices in the named columns, and number of rows equal to the total number of time-slices on the lowest level.}

\item{\code{slice_share}}{two column data.frame with slices from all levels with their individual share in a year.}

\item{\code{default_frame}}{character, the name of the default level of the time-slices used in the model.}

\item{\code{slices_in_frame}}{(!!! to depreciate)}

\item{\code{slice_family}}{data.frame mapping "parent" to "child" slices in the nested hierarchy.}

\item{\code{slice_ancestry}}{data.frame mapping all "(grand-)parent" to all "(grand-)children".}

\item{\code{misc}}{list with additional data and calculated mappings.}
