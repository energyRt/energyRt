\title{An S4 class to represent model input}
\description{
\code{modInp} class is used to store interpolated date for the model input parameters.
It includes all the model sets, mappings, and parameters, interpolated to the
scenario's calendar and horizon. The class is automatically created during the
interpolation step and is not intended to be created by users.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{set}}{list. named list of character vectors with sets used in the model.}

\item{\code{parameters}}{list. named list of \code{parameter} objects with three tipes - set: detailed description of the set - parameter: all model parameters, interpolated for every milestone
year in the model horizon if applicable. Names of parameters start
with 'p'
\itemize{
\item mapping sets: auxiliary, automatically created sets used to narrow
the dimension of variables and constraints
}}

\item{\code{gams.equation}}{list. named list of custom constraints added to the model from the \code{constraint} class. The name of the slot is outdated and will be changed in the future.}

\item{\code{costs.equation}}{list. named list of custom costs added to the model's objective from the \code{costs} class. The name of the slot is outdated and will be changed in the future.}

\item{\code{misc}}{list. Any additional information or data to store in the object. Also used to store paths to the data files of objects stored on the disk.}
