\describe{
\item{\code{name}}{character. Name of the horizon object. Used to distinguish between different horizons in the model or scenario, including the automatic creation of the folder name for the model/scenario scripts.}

\item{\code{desc}}{character. Description of the horizon object, for own references.}

\item{\code{period}}{integer. A planning period defined as a sequence of years (arranged, without gaps) of the model planning (e.g. optimization) window. Data with years before or after the planning \code{period} can present in the model-objects and will be taken into account during interpolation of the model parameters.}

\item{\code{intervals}}{data.frame. Data frame with three columns, representing start, middle, and the end year of every interval. The first column is the start year of the interval, the second column is the middle year of the interval, the third column is the end year of the interval.}
