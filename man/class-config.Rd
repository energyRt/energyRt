\title{An S4 class to represent default model configuration.}
\description{
Config class is used to represent the default model configuration.
It is stored in the model object and is used to initialize the
scenario settings.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{name}}{character. Name of the configuration object for own references, also can be used  in functions to distinguish between different model or scenario instances.}

\item{\code{desc}}{character. Description of the configuration object for own references.}

\item{\code{region}}{character. Coma separated string of all region names in the model. All regions used in the model-objects should be listed here.}

\item{\code{calendar}}{calendar. Calendar object with the model time parameters.}

\item{\code{horizon}}{horizon. Horizon object with the model time parameters. The horizon defines the planning period and intervals of the model.}

\item{\code{discount}}{data.frame. Discount rates, can be assigned by region and year.
\describe{
\item{region}{character. Region name to apply the parameter, NA for every region.}
\item{year}{integer. Year to apply the parameter, NA for every year.}
\item{discount}{numeric. Discount rate. Default is 0.05. The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of future costs and benefits.}
}}

\item{\code{discountFirstYear}}{logical. If TRUE, the discounting starts from the beginning of the year. If FALSE, the discounting starts from the end of the first year, i.e., the first year is not discounted.}

\item{\code{optimizeRetirement}}{logical. Incidates if the retirement of capacities of the model objects  should be optimized. Also requires the same parameter in the classes with capacitu, such as \code{technology}, \code{storage}, \code{trade} to be set to TRUE to be effective for a specific object.}

\item{\code{defVal}}{data.frame. Default values of model parameters. The data frame with the default values for every parameter in the model, used to fill the missing values in the model objects. The values are used in the interpolation step. The data is stored in \code{energyRt::.defVal} object and can be overwritten by the user and supplied to the model as a parameter.}

\item{\code{interpolation}}{data.frame. Default interpolation rules for every parameter in the model. The data frame with the default interpolation rules is stored in \code{energyRt::.defInt} object and can be overwritten by the user and supplied to the model as a parameter.}

\item{\code{debug}}{data.frame. Artificial (dummy or sluck) variables to debug model infeasibility. Can be specified by commodities, regions, years, and slices.}

\item{\code{misc}}{list. Any additional data or information to store in the object.}
