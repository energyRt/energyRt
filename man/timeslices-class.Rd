\description{
An S4 class to represent sub-annual time resolution structure (time slices).
}
\details{
Sub-annual time resolution is represented by nested, named fractions of a year ("slices").
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{structure}}{a named list of nested sub-annual levels with vectors of individual elements.}

\item{\code{table}}{data.frame with levels of slices in the named columns, and number of rows equal to the total number of time-slices on the lowest level.}

\item{\code{share}}{two column data.frame with slices from all levels with their individual share in a year.}

\item{\code{family}}{data.frame mapping "parent" to "child" slices in the nested hierarchy.}

\item{\code{ancestry}}{data.frame mapping all "(grand-)parent" to all "(grand-)children".}

\item{\code{defLevel}}{character, the name of the default level of the time-slices used in the model.}

\item{\code{misc}}{list with additional data and calculated mappings.}
