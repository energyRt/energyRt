\usage{
newCalendar(
  name = "",
  desc = "",
  timetable = NULL,
  year_fraction = 1,
  default_timeframe = NULL,
  misc = list(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character. Name of the calendar object. Use to distingush between different structures and subsets of time-slices. The name is used to propose default folder names for the model/scenario scripts to separate solutions of the same scenario with different calendar objects.}

\item{desc}{character. Description of the calendar object, for own references.}

\item{timetable}{data.frame. Data frame with levels of timeframes in the named columns, and number of rows equal to the total number of time-slices on the lowest level. Every timeframe is a set of time-slices ("slices") - a named fragment of time with a year-share. Timeframes have nested structure where every slice serves as a parent for the lower level of time-slices (children). The first column is the name of the time-slice, the rest of the columns are the names of the timeframes. The values are the share of the year covered by the time-slice. The sum of the shares in every timeframe should be equal to 1. \code{weight} is an optional column with the weight of the time-slice in the year, used for sumpled/subset selection of the time-slices.}

\item{year_fraction}{numeric. The fraction of a year covered by the calendar, e.g. 1 for annual calendar (default), 0.5 for semi-annual, 0.25 for quarterly, etc. Currently must be specified manually for subset calendars to validate the sum of the shares.}

\item{default_timeframe}{character. The name of the default level of the time-slices used in the model. If not specified, the lowest level of the timeframes is used as the default timeframe.}

\item{misc}{list. Any additional data or information to store in the object.}

\item{...}{ignored}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{calendar} with the specified structure.
}
\description{
Calendars are defined by the structure of timeframes and time-slices
with shares of time in a year. The structure is represented by a
\code{timetable} data.frame with levels of timeframes in the named columns,
and names of individual time-slices in every timeframe.
The number of rows in \code{timetable} is equal to the total number
of time-slices on the lowest level.
Every timeframe is a set of timeslices ("slices") - a named fragment
of time with a year-share. Timeframes have nested structure.
Currently, every "parent"-timeframe must have the same number of
elements as the "child"-timeframe. (This may change in the future.)
\describe{
\item{ANNUAL}{character, annual, the top level of timeframes}
\item{TIMEFRAME2}{character, (optional) first subannual level of timeframes}
\item{TIMEFRAME3}{character, (optional) second subannual level of timeframes}
\item{...}{character, (optional) further subannual levels of timeframes}
\item{slice}{character, name of the time-slices used in sets to refer to the lowest level of timeframes. If not specified, will be auto-created with the formula: \verb{\{SLICE2\}_\{SLICE3\}...}}
