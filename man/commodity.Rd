\item{name}{character, a short name used in sets, no white spaces or special characters}

\item{desc}{character, a description of the commodity}

\item{limtype}{character or factor, the limit type of the commodity
in balance equation ("LO" by default, meaning that the level of commodity in
the model is satisfied with the lower bound)}

\item{timeframe}{character, the default time-frame this commodity operates
in the model (the lowest timeframe used by default)}

\item{unit}{character, the physical unit of the commodity used in the model,
currently for information only.}

\item{agg}{data.frame, if the commodity is an aggregation of several commodities,
this data.frame contains the aggregation parameters of the listed commodities
into the \code{name} commodity.}

\item{emis}{data.frame, emission factors of the commodity, if the commodity
is consumed by a technology with combustion parameter > 0, the listed in the
slot commodities will be emitted.}

\item{misc}{list, a list with miscellaneous information to store.
