# Intoduction
This tutorial demonstrates the application of `energyRt` package to develop a **Reference Energy System** (RES, or  **Energy system optimization**) model and conduct standard analysis, i.e. run scenarios, optimize several alternative development pathways of the simplified energy system. The initial (base-year) structure of the discussed below example of RES is flexible. The following features can be easily adjusted:  
  * number of regions and the model GIS-info (the *map*),  
  * the model horizon and annual time-steps ("milestone years"),  
  * number and levels of sub-annual time-steps ("time slices"),  
  * technological options, commodities, storage, supply, and demand,  
  * interregional trade and trade with the rest of the world (ROW),  
  * constraints on the model variables.  
  
The `energyRt` package provides a set of S4 classes, methods, and functions to design the model elements, such as technologies, commodities, supply, demand, and constraints, save them in a `model` object, process the data and save it in a format readable by solver-software (GAMS, GLPK/Mathprog, Python/Pyomo, or Julia/JuMP), run the model code in the solver-software, read the results back to R, and manipulate the data to produce charts and tables.  

This Vignette tutorial can be acquired from the `energyRt/vignetts` folder (or <https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/vignettes>). It can be run step-by-step or at once to reproduce the results below. Playing with parameters and data is highly recommended for learning the package and the RES-models. This is the first beta-version of the package and the tutorial. Please report bugs, issues, thoughts here: <https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/issues>.    

# Prerequisites
We assume that `R` (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and `RStudio` (<https://www.rstudio.com/>) has been already installed, and a scholar has some basic knowledge of `R`. The next step is to have installed `energyRt`, the solver software (`GAMS` or `GLPK`) and `LaTeX`. The detailed installation steps are available on the package website (<https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/>).   
```{r setup}
# Choose your solver-software
mysolver <- "GLPK"
# mysolver = "JuMP"
# mysolver <- "Pyomo"
# mysolver <- "GAMS"


# Load required packages

```

# Utopia map  
Let's start with a multi-region map for the model. Below we use GIS info of this imaginary country for visualization of results and also to calculate some parameters for renewables, like solar radiation, and distances between regions. Several options of 11-region map with arbitrary GIS info is saved in `energyRt/data` folder and compared on the figure below.  

## Available options

```{r utopia_maps_figure, fig.cap="Map options for Utopia models, up to 11 regions.", fig.height=5, fig.width=7, eval=FALSE}
# source("depreciated/R/choropleth.R")
maps <- names(utopia$map)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = seq(0.1, 4))
for (i in 1:4) {
  # stop()
  gis <- utopia$map[[i]]  # load map
  plot(gis["region"], main = maps[i], bg = "aliceblue", key.pos = NULL,
       reset = T)
  # cn <- get_labpt_spdf(gis) # get coordinates of the regions' centers
  # text(gis$x, gis$y, labels = gis$region)
}
rm(gis, list = ls(pattern = "utopia_")) # clean-up
dev.off() # reset graphical parameters
```

Certainly, any other map in `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` (spdf) format and with saved names of regions in `@data$region` column of the spdf object can be used instead. For this particular example lets pick `utopia_honeycomb` map and keep the `7` first regions for the simulation.
```{r Utopia_map, fig.cap="The selected map for the Utopia model."}
# data("utopia_honeycomb") # , package = "energyRt")
gis <- utopia$map$honeycomb
# rm(utopia_honeycomb)
gis <- gis[1:7, ]
# gis <- gis[-c(8:9),]

# Often used parameters
(reg_names <- as.character(gis$region)) # Region names
(nreg <- length(reg_names)) # Number of regions
# reg_centers <- getCenters(gis) # Coordinates of the regions' centers
# rownames(reg_centers) <- reg_centers$region

if (F) {
  # Basic map - skipped
  par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = seq(0.1, 4))
  plot(gis,
    col = 1:length(gis), main = paste("Utopia", length(gis), "regions"),
    bg = "aliceblue"
  )
  text(reg_centers$x, reg_centers$y, labels = reg_names)
  class(gis)
}
```
   
## Mapping with ggplot
Further we will rely on `ggplot` package for figures and maps, which requires the intput data in `data.frame` format, here are the required conversions and the final map.

```{r Utopia_map_ggplot, fig.cap="The selected map for the Utopia model using ggplot."}
# Converting spdf to data.frame
# ggis <- gis %>%
#   fortify(region = "region") %>%
#   as_tibble()
ggis <- gis

ggplot(ggis) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = region)) +
  # geom_polygon(aes(fill = id), colour = rgb(1, 1, 1, 0.5)) +
  # geom_polygon(aes(fill = id), colour = "white", size = 1) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # coord_quickmap() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(fill = "Region", title = paste("Utopia,", nrow(gis), "regions")) +
  geom_text(aes(x, y, label = region), inherit.aes = FALSE)
```
 

# Sub-annual time resolution
Here are examples of sub-annual time hierarchy (time-slices or `slices`), from one to four levels. The number of levels and their names are flexible (except the upper 'ANNUAL' level). The names of the levels are important, they are used as key-words in the definition of commodities and technologies.

## Annual (default)
For some models, sub-annual time granularity is not needed and can be dropped. This also assumed by default, if slices are not specified, the model will have the annual resolution. Though we can also define this for demonstration of the time-level structures.
```{r time_slices1}
# 1 time slice - ANNUAL
timeslices1 <- list(
  ANNUAL = "ANNUAL" # This level should present in every time-slices structure
)
```

## Seasons and typical hours
We can add more levels - seasons or months, weeks, and hours. They should be saved in nested lists. Here is an example with seasons (Winter, Summer, spRing, Autumn), and hours (Day, Night, Peak). The first element in each list is the share of this particular slice in the level. The sum of shares on each level should be equal to one.
```{r time_slices2}
# 4x3 = 24 slices
timeslices2 <- list(
  ANNUAL = "ANNUAL", # required
  # SEASON = c(W = list(1/4,
  # For consistency with other structures, lets rename SEASON to MONTH
  MONTH = list(
    W = list(1 / 4, # share of the Winter season in the year
      HOUR = list(
        D = 9 / 24, # share of day-hours in Winter
        N = 12 / 24, # share of night-hours in Winter
        P = 3 / 24
      )
    ), # share of peak hours in Winter
    R = list(1 / 4, # share of the spRing season in the year
      HOUR = list(
        D = 11 / 24, # share of day-hours in spRing
        N = 11 / 24, # share of night-hours in spRing
        P = 2 / 24
      )
    ), # share of peak hours in spRing
    S = list(1 / 4, # share of the Summer season in the year
      HOUR = list(
        D = 12 / 24, # share of day-hours in Summer
        N = 9 / 24, # share of night-hours in Summer
        P = 3 / 24
      )
    ), # share of peak hours in Summer)
    A = list(1 / 4, # share of the Autumn season in the year
      HOUR = list(
        D = 11 / 24, # share of day-hours in Autumn
        N = 11 / 24, # share of night-hours in Autumn
        P = 2 / 24
      )
    ) # share of peak hours in Autumn)
  )
)
```
Four seasons and the three groups of hours will result in 12 sub-annual time-slices. If the spring and fall have similar parameters and can be aggregated into one season, reducing the total number of slices to 9. Though there might be reasons to separate them if, for example, the final demand is significantly different in the seasons, or some resources (like hydro-power) have a different profile in autumn and spring.

## Months and representative day hours
It is probably more natural to operate with real months and real hours, and easier from a data perspective. The following example has 12 months and 24 hours for each month, considering one representative day per month. Therefore this will result in 288 time slices per every year of the model. However, higher granularity comes with a computational penalty. Though for our toy model with only a few technologies, this is not a level of concern yet. If we disregard the differences in the length of the months, then the definition of time slices will be even easier - we won't have to specify any shares, they will be assumed as equal during the model compilation.  

```{r time_slices3}
# 24*1*12 = 288 time slices, two sub-annual levels
timeslices3 <- list(
  ANNUAL = "ANNUAL", # this name is fixed, should not be changes
  MONTH = paste0("m", formatC(1:12, width = 2, flag = "0")),
  HOUR = paste0("h", formatC(0:23, width = 2, flag = "0"))
)
```


We have defined 3 different options of sub-annual time steps. The first option has only one level ("ANNUAL"), and two others also have months (or seasons) and groups of typical hours. The following definition of the model objects will rely on the chosen time structure. For example, some commodities or technologies can have higher granularity and will appear in the hour-level equations. Whereas others may have annual or season/month-level time resolution, that means they will appear only in their level balance equations. The names of slice levels and slices should be consistent across the model objects. Therefore the time-structure is fixed, model-specific. To make it a bit more flexible for playing with alternative specifications, we can have several time-structure with the same names of levels, like in lists `timeslices2` and `timeslices3` above. They both have "ANNUAL", "MONTH", and "HOUR" levels. Though the names of the slice-elements will be different, and we will have to avoid using them in the model specification.    

```{r}
# Now let's create names for the slices, the elements of the time-slices set
# They will be auto-generated in the model, but we may need them in definition of
# technologies and other objects.

# timeslices1 <- list(
#   ANNUAL = "ANNUAL", MONTH = list(1, HOUR = list(H = 1))
# )

# timeSlices(timeslices1) # Experimental -- not working yet
make_timetable(timeslices2)
make_timetable(timeslices3)

# Choose time slices level
timeslices <- timeslices2
# timeslices <- timeslices3

slc <- make_timetable(timeslices)
(nslc <- length(slc$slice))
(nmon <- length(timeslices$MONTH))
(nhou <- nslc / nmon)
```
We will assign the time slices to the model-object later, but may also need the structure and/or names of the slices in the definition of other objects, such as technologies, demand, and supply, therefore useful to have them ready.


# Electric power sector
Electric generation is likely the most often modeled sector of RES. It has a number of alternative technological options which can be evaluated and compared with RES-models. The minimum set for the model is a declaration of commodities, technologies, supply, demand, and basic system parameters, like time-slices, as discussed above.

## Commodities  
A "commodity" notion in the model is a generalization of goods, services, or emissions. Commodities link processes such as supply, technologies, demands as input or output. The minimum requirements to declare commodity is its name. Additional parameters can be stored in the class `commodity` for information and processing, most of the slots are currently reserved to be used in user-defined functions. The preferred way to create the class and fill it with data is the `newCommodity()` function as shown below.   

```{r commodities}
COA <- newCommodity(
  name = "COA", # the name as it appears in the solver-software and the model sets
  desc = "Generic coal", # just a comment
  emis = list( # emissions, associated with fuels combustion (see the flags in technologies)
    comm = "CO2", # this commodity (CO2) is emmited when the fuel (COA) is used
    unit = "kt/PJ", # the unit of emissions for refference
    emis = 100 # i.e. 100 kt of CO2 emmitted per one unit of energy (1 PJ)
  ),
  slice = "ANNUAL" # 'ANNUAL' means no sub-annual granularity for the commodity
  # color = "brown" # reserved for output figures, optional
)

OIL <- newCommodity(
  name = "OIL",
  desc = "Oil and oil products",
  emis = list(
    comm = "CO2",
    emis = 80
  ),
  slice = "ANNUAL"
)

GAS <- newCommodity(
  name = "GAS",
  desc = "Natural gas",
  emis = list(
    comm = "CO2",
    unit = "kt/PJ",
    emis = 70
  ),
  slice = "MONTH" # This commodity will appear in month-level equations
)

CH4 <- newCommodity(
  name = "CH4",
  desc = "Methan emmisions",
  slice = "MONTH"
)

BIO <- newCommodity(
  name = "BIO",
  desc = "Generic biomass, all types",
  slice = "ANNUAL"
)

# More energy commodities with less details
ELC <- newCommodity("ELC", desc = "Electricity", slice = "HOUR")
HVE <- newCommodity("HVE", desc = "High voltage electricity", slice = "HOUR")
UHV <- newCommodity("UHV", desc = "Ultra high voltage electricity", slice = "HOUR")
NUC <- newCommodity("NUC", desc = "Nuclear fuel", slice = "ANNUAL")
HYD <- newCommodity("HYD", desc = "Hydro energy", slice = "HOUR")
SOL <- newCommodity("SOL", desc = "Solar energy", slice = "HOUR")
WIN <- newCommodity("WIN", desc = "Wind energy", slice = "HOUR")

# Emissions
CO2 <- newCommodity("CO2", desc = "Carbon dioxide emissions", slice = "HOUR")
NOX <- newCommodity("NOX", desc = "Nitrogen oxide emissions", slice = "HOUR")
SO2 <- newCommodity("SO2", desc = "Sulfur dioxide emissions", slice = "MONTH")
HG <- newCommodity("HG", desc = "Mercury emissions", slice = "HOUR")
PM <- newCommodity("PM", desc = "Particulate matter emissions", slice = "ANNUAL")
```

## The final demand
The final product in this model will be electricity (ELC), the final demand for ELC is exogenous. Since we defined *ELC* as an hour-level commodity, we specify demand for every time slice (the load curve) and every region where it is consumed. The number of hours (or groups of hours) is equal to the time-slices. In the case of the    
### Demand by months and hours hours
Now let's specify annual, monthly, and hourly demand for electricity, assuming that every region has a different level of ELC consumptions and the loadcurve. Instead of googling and web-scrapping the Utopia's load curve, we generate it randomly for our example.  

```{r demand_MH_baseYear}
# Annual demand in 2015
elc_dem_a <- tibble(
  region = reg_names,
  year = 2015,
  GWh = seq(5000, by = 500, length.out = nreg)
)
elc_dem_a

fLoadCurve <- function(n = 24, seed = NULL, delt = 24 / n / 20) {
  # a function to generate an arbitrary load curve
  if (!is.null(seed)) set.seed(seed)
  iter <- TRUE
  lc <- 1.
  for (i in 2:n) {
    # ARMA
    lc[i] <- 1 * lc[i - 1] + -.1 * (lc[i - 1] - 1) + runif(1, -delt, delt)
  }
  (0 + lc) * n / sum(lc + 0)
}

# Hourly demand for every region
set.seed(1)
dem <- tibble(
  region = rep(reg_names, each = nslc),
  year = 2015,
  slice = rep(slc$slice, nreg),
  GWh = c(sapply(elc_dem_a$GWh, function(x) {
    (x * fLoadCurve(nmon)) %x% fLoadCurve(nhou)
  })) / nslc
)
head(dem)
sum(dem$GWh)

# Check by aggregating back to annual numbers
dem %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(GWh_agg = sum(GWh)) %>%
  mutate(GWh_a = elc_dem_a$GWh)

# Add month and hour for plots
# dem$month <- month.abb[as.numeric(substr(dem$slice, 2, 3))]
# dem$hour <- as.integer(substr(dem$slice, 6, 7))
dem <- left_join(dem, select(slc, MONTH, HOUR, slice, share), by = "slice") %>%
  rename(month = MONTH)
dem$hour <- as.numeric(as.factor(dem$HOUR))

ggplot(dem, aes(hour, GWh)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = region)) +
  ylim(c(0, NA)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ month) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "(Assumed) Electricity consumption by hours in the base year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The demand for 2015 is done, now we need to provide projections of the demand up to the last year of the model horizon, and with the same level of granularity (regions * slices) as the base year, and the commodity (ELC) itself. We can specify the demand for every (milestone) year of the model horizon, or some of them. The values between specified years will be interpolated If the model horizon goes beyond the last year, the final values will be used for interpolation forward.     
```{r demand_MH_forecast}
# Adding annual demand for 2030 and 2055
elc_dem_2030 <- dem
elc_dem_2030$year <- 2030
elc_dem_2030$GWh <- dem$GWh * 2 # assuming two-fold growth by 2030

elc_dem_2055 <- dem
elc_dem_2055$year <- 2055 # The model horizon
elc_dem_2055$GWh <- dem$GWh * 3 # and 3-times by 2055

elc_dem <- dem %>%
  bind_rows(elc_dem_2030) %>%
  bind_rows(elc_dem_2055)

# The model units in PJ, converting...
elc_dem$PJ <- convert("GWh", "PJ", elc_dem$GWh)
elc_dem$region <- as.character(elc_dem$region)

# a <- (load("~/R/energyRt/solwork/UTOPIA_BASE_Julia/data.RData"))
# dat$pDemand %>% as.data.table()
# scen_BASE_int@modInp@parameters$pDemand@data
# scen_BASE_int@modInp@parameters$pDemand@data <- dat$pDemand %>%
  # as.data.table()

# replace data for banchmarking
# elc_dem <- elc_dem %>% 
#   left_join(select(dat$pDemand, region, year, slice, value)) %>%
#   mutate(PJ = value) %>% select(-value)

DEM_ELC <- newDemand(
  name = "DEM_ELC",
  desc = "Final demand for electricity",
  commodity = "ELC",
  dem = list(
    year = elc_dem$year,
    region = elc_dem$region,
    slice = elc_dem$slice,
    dem = elc_dem$PJ
  )
)
dim(DEM_ELC@dem)
unique(DEM_ELC@dem$year)
length(unique(DEM_ELC@dem$region))
length(unique(DEM_ELC@dem$slice))
```


## Primary supply  
Primary commodities, such as primary energy sources, materials, appear in the RES-model either by export from the rest of the world, or supply. Neither, supply or export from ROW has capacity per se. The main difference between them is the origin of the commodity if it is domestic or foreign Here we assume that different regions of Utopia have different resources to stimulate trade between them. Function `newSupply` creates `supply` object with declared parameters. The annual, regional, or slice-level limits, as well as costs, can be assigned with `availability` parameters.     

```{r supply_COA}
# If we assume that coal is abundunt resource, available in every region with the same price,
# we don't have to declare @region of the supply.
SUP_COA <- newSupply(
  name = "SUP_COA",
  desc = "Supply of coal",
  commodity = "COA",
  unit = "PJ",
  reserve = list(res.up = 1e6), # total limit of the resource (i.e. deposits)
  region = reg_names[1],
  availability = list(
    year = c(2015, 2030, 2050),
    ava.up = c(1000, 2000, 1000), # the upper bound on availability of the commodity
    cost = c(convert("USD/tce", "MUSD/PJ", c(50, 60, 70) * .7)) # assumed price per 1PJ
  ),
  slice = "ANNUAL"
)
```

The saved parameter can be checked in `SUP_COA@availability` slot:

```{r, results="markup", echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(SUP_COA@availability, caption = "")
```
  
The `NA` values mean "for all" by default in columns with sets (`region`, `year`, `slice`) or "no constraint" in columns with numeric parameters. The values between the specified years will be linearly interpolated by default.  
Similarly, for other primary commodities:  

```{r supply_all_Other}
set.seed(100)
SUP_GAS <- newSupply(
  name = "SUP_GAS",
  desc = "Supply of natural gas",
  commodity = "GAS",
  unit = "PJ",
  reserve = list(res.up = runif(1, 1e3, 1e6)), #
  region = reg_names[min(2, nreg)], # only those regions will have the supply
  availability = list(
    year = c(2015, 2030, 2050),
    ava.up = c(1000, 2000, 1000),
    cost = c(convert("USD/tce", "MUSD/PJ", c(60, 70, 80) * .7))
  ),
  slice = "ANNUAL"
)

SUP_NUC <- newSupply(
  name = "SUP_NUC",
  commodity = "NUC",
  availability = list(
    cost = convert("USD/MWh", "MUSD/PJ", 4) # assumed
  ),
  slice = "ANNUAL"
)

RES_HYD <- newSupply(
  name = "RES_HYD",
  commodity = "HYD",
  availability = data.frame(
    ava.up = 1e3,
    cost = 0 # no price to the resource, can be dropped
  )
)

RES_SOL <- newSupply(
  name = "RES_SOL",
  commodity = "SOL"
  # availability will be defined by weather factors (see below)
)

RES_WIN <- newSupply(
  name = "RES_WIN",
  commodity = "WIN"
  # availability will be defined by weather factors (see below)
)
```


## Technologies  
Technologies (techs) are the key part of the RES-modeling. This topic is broad and deserves a separate tutorial (in progress). By now, the main ideas to keep in mind:  
-- techs take some commodities as input and generate other as output;  
-- there are several levels of transformation of input into output, with two main intermediate steps: `use` and `activity`;  
-- `use` can be seen as an aggregation of all inputs with various weights into one level, then 
all the comm...

## Interregional trade
The trade is basically a definition of trade routes between regions for each commodity and each direction. There are many ways to arrange the trade routes, which is growing with the number of regions. Here we define trade between neihbor regions, which opens flows between all uninsulated regions. The neighbor regions can be obtained based on the GIS info.  
```{r trade}
# Neighbor regions
# nbr <- spdep::poly2nb(gis, snap = .001)
# sf::st_relate(gis, gis, pattern = "F***1****", sparse = T)
# nbr <- sf::st_intersects(st_buffer(gis, .01), gis, sparse = F)
# names(nbr) <- gis$region
# class(nbr)
# 
# # Trade matrix
# trd_nbr <- matrix(rep(NA, nreg * nreg),
#   nrow = nreg,
#   dimnames = list(reg_names, reg_names)
# )

# for (i in 1:length(reg_names)) {
#   trd_nbr[i, nbr[[i]]] <- 1
#   trd_nbr[nbr[[i]], i] <- 1
# }
# dim(trd_nbr)
# head(trd_nbr)

trd_nbr <- sf::st_intersects(sf::st_buffer(gis, .01), gis, sparse = F)
trd_nbr[lower.tri(trd_nbr, diag = T)] <- FALSE
dimnames(trd_nbr) <- list(reg_names, reg_names)
# trd_nbr[] <- as.integer(trd_nbr)

```

`r knitr::kable(trd_nbr, caption = "Trade routes matrix.")`  

We can visualize the open trade routes over the map.  
```{r trade_map, fig.cap="Trade routes."}

  as.data.frame.table(stringsAsFactors = F) %>%

For every trade-route, direction, and every traded commodity we have to define an object of class `trade` to open the trades in the model. To simplify the process, we can group the trades by source regions. Therefore we will have up to `r nreg` trade objects.  


### Trade
For electric power sector model, we can potentially consider trades as dispatch, adding various levels of voltages, or we may want to add an option for primary commodities trade between regions. In this simplified demonstration we define trade for electricity itself, without consideration of different levels of voltages, as well as investments in grid. It can be done adding into the model more technologies, such as transformers, and the grid-lines. Though this type of models don't have such details as grid simulation models have. ... 

```{r trade_class}
# Define trade losses

We can check the shares of the time-slices which are auto-calculated assuming that all slices have the same weights. This works for 24 hours, but the weights for every month can be specified to take the difference in months length.
```{r show_timeslices_length, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

### The model horizon and annual time-steps (`milesone years`)
If we don't need year-by-year steps, milestone years (MSY) can be specifyed to reduce the model dimention. The function `setMilestoneYears` takes as arguments the model start year and the intervals between MSYs, and calculates the interval years (start and end) for each milestone year.
