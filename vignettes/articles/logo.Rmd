"The energyRt project is in the process of searching for its logo-identity, which reflects its name (/ˈɛnərdʒi ɑrt/), purpose (macro energy systems modeling, long-term energy landscapes, energy transition, and decarbonization), and modular object-oriented workflow (similar to LEGO blocks or a jigsaw puzzle). Additionally, the logo will follow the hexagon conventions commonly used in R logos."

In this age of AI, with tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E, why not tap into the collective knowledge of human creativity? That’s exactly what we did. While none of the AI-generated logos are perfect straight out of the box—given the current state of AI—they do offer intriguing perspectives and design ideas. As part of an ongoing, iterative process, the most promising prototypes will serve as energyRt logo for a week, before being replaced by another one, until the final design is chosen.

If you’d like to share your own logo idea, feel free to submit it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/issues) or send it by [email](<optimal2050@optimalsolution.dev>).
