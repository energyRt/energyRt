The *energyRt* model comprises around 90 predefined equations (linear constraints) to describe an energy system and its operation. Additional constraints can be added using *newConstraint* methods or added to the model code directly. The original model has been formulated in [GAMS](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/gams), and translated in [Python/Pyomo](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/pyomo), [GLPK/Mathprog](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/glpk), and [Julia/JuMP](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/julia). Mathematical formulation of *energyRt* model (with dropped mapping parameters in equations for readability) can be found [here](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/blob/master/vignettes/articles/energyRt_model_equations.pdf).
