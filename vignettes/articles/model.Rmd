The **energyRt** model comprises around one hundred predefined equations to describe an energy technologies, energy system and its operation. Additional equations can be added using *newConstraint* methods or added to the model code directly. The model is formulated in four alternative math-programming languages: [GAMS](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/gams), [Python/Pyomo](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/pyomo), [GLPK/Mathprog](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/glpk), and [Julia/JuMP](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/tree/master/julia). Mathematical formulation of **energyRt** can be found [her](https://github.com/energyRt/energyRt/blob/master/vignettes/articles/energyRt_model_equations.pdf)[e](https://energyrt.github.io/book/model.html).
